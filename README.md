# PostmanClone

A simple webapp that performs HTTP requests with the help of Python's "requests" module as proxy at the backend to execute the API calls. Can be used to test local REST APIs.

Features:
1) Select from 4 HTTP requests: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
2) Specify request headers with upto 6 items in JSON format.
3) Specify body in customizable JSON format with visible changes.
4) Get response in both JSON and text/html view.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
